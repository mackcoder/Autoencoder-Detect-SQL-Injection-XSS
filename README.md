## üìùDesciption
<div align="justify">
  This study aims to improve website defense systems through unsupervised machine
learning methods to detect SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Using Python and artificial intelligence libraries, an autoencoder model was developed and
trained to identify anomalous patterns in web traffic. Publicly available datasets were applied
for training and validation. The results indicated high efficiency in detecting SQL Injection,
with strong recall and low false negatives, although with high false positive rates for XSS
detection. It is concluded that the proposed approach is promising but requires further
optimization before being used in production environments

## üîé Implementation and Experimental Setup
  All following experiments were conducted using the **GoogleColab** enviroment.

  ## üìö Libraries Used
  - numpy - For numerical operations and array manipulation
  - pandas - For data loading and preprocessing
  - scikit-learn - For model evaluation, data splitting and scaling
  - tensorflow - For building and training the Autoencoder model
  - keras - High-level API for defining neural network layers
  - classification_report & confusion_matrix - For performance metrics
